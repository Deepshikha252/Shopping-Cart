Instead of creating a static shopping list with paper and a pen, create it dynamically. Take the list item and the price from the user and further find the grand total.
Details:

Two input fields should be displayed that take name and price as input.

A button with innerText Add should be rendered.

When the add button is clicked, list should be updated and rendered through a table.

data-ns-test="item-name" and data-ns-test="item-price" should be used to label name and price in table

item-name-input and item-price-input should be used as id for name and price input fields.

Total price of all element in the list should be displayed in an element with data-ns-test="grandTotal". This element should only have the value of the total and no other string.

Input fields should be cleared once element has been added to the list

Initially, table should have only one row with grandTotal as 0.

Invalid input should not be accepted.
